bazaarBot - Java
=========

This is a translation of the original bazaarbot module to Java with some minor changes / fixes ( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/larsiusprime/bazaarBot )

I will probably continue to make changes / refactor or expand this code as I integrate it with my current game, Project Station 13.

bazaarBot - Original Description
=========

A simple agent-based free market simulator engine.

This engine consists of various "Agents" trading commodities, with emergent free-floating prices that rise and fall according to the laws of supply and demand.

The eventual goal is to create an open-source "Economics engine" for games and simulations, much like contemporary open-source "Physics engines."

Based on "[Emergent Economies for Role Playing Games](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Emergent-Economies-for-Role-Playing-Games-Doran-Parberry/e9330d06ec6a830aa1dd2cd9e6bc38daa95db6dd)" by Jonathon Doran and Ian Parberry.
